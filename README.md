# Opt-In-Opt-Out-Module
This is a module I created to store whether a customer opted into a newsletter or not. The customer's email address is stored in a new database table and then can be viewed in a table in the back end of the website by the client.

The module files are under app/code/local/Smart/Optinandout
The file to make the module work is under app/etc/modules/
The script needed to pass the data over is under design/base/default/template and is in a file called payment.phtml
